I love getting to share counter intutitve ideas of building agentic AI with other people and I mostly stick to twitter when I write about it. Here's a small collection of my writings but you can find a lot more if you [follow me on twitter](https://x.com/arafatkatze).

This post is about open source model labs like MiniMax are actually doing extraordinary work with smaller models which are just as good as the larger ones
