These are messages to people I've known, loved, disappointed, or been shaped by. Names are omitted intentionally, because perhaps you've known these people too.

1. You are a good dude and I see so much potential in you, please prove me right by doing something really cool and awesome with your life. 
2. You changed my life upside down  for the better but my own shame got in between us,  I am so sorry for disappointing you in all the ways that I did and hopefully someday you will be able to forgive me. 

3. I don't think you believe a word of what you are saying even when you claim to be a believer.  You are more interested in making people feel that you believe in something rather than actually believing in something yourself which is sad because if you were just honest people would like you a lot. 
4. I have never loved someone more and been disappointed by them more than I was by you.  I still wish you well and I hope you find your bliss after all these years.
5. Your love has shown me that just about anything is possible, I wish you loved yourself just as much as you loved me.

 6. Depending on the day and the time I think of you, I oscillate between calling you a monster or perhaps a troubled soul. No matter how many years pass, I suppose I will never know.  
 
 7. You made it so so hard to love you but I still kept choosing you until one day it became clear that  you wanted me to stop and I did.  

 8. You have a long way to go my man, keep moving and exploring. 
 9. You're the smartest unfinished person I know, don't let potential be written on your tombstone. 
 10. If you knew how many nights I have laid in bed thinking of you, you would see me very differently. Let's be friends again(not that we aren't friends, but I mean like really be friends like we used to be). 
 11. The amount of love in your heart is so big that flows out of you into the people you meet, there's a  calmness in your presence that kept me grounded. 
 
12. I knew you had to do what you had to do, I get it, but it was still really cruel. Fuck you!
13. I know we were just colleagues but you are so much more than that to me, I am really really gonna miss you,  nerd, you are my favourite nerd in the world. Your strange voice is something I won't forget.

14. I don't know how different life would have been if I hadn't met you. Unbeknownst to you, I try to be extra nice to strangers in distress in hopes that somehow the grace you showed me can be paid back in an odd sort of universal karmic calculus. 

15. You are a funny dude but also a kind of a psychopath from time to time. But then again, youth can  justify a lot of things. 

16. Was it you? really just tell me the truth, if it was you or was it somebody else?  

17.  I see so much light in you but I donâ€™t know why that is, I hope you make the best of your 20s.
18. Your life can literally be a movie and it would still be underwhelming.  You made me want to be a better person, I wish we were friends in real life and not just online talking every few weeks.  

19. I can't believe how your real life and professional life are so different. And as much as I like to troll  whenever I am around you, I really respect and look up to you.  

20. I really like you a lot you know, I know I am not allowed to say it because we have a mutual pact of playful rivalry but you are so pretty and funny and I wish to see you more. 

21. You are the reason I like sophisticated English people. 

22. What the fuck bro, you were so so cool? What happened?  Can't believe you became like the rest of them. 

23. You have such a deep moral compass, I really admire that about you. I wish I had matured as fast  as you did but knowing you, I know it's not too late, I can still do it.  
      
24. You taught me how to be a good man, I will never be able to repay you for that but I will try to be a good person and hope that works out.
