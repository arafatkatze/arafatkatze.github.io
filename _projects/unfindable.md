title: If You Can't Find Your Story, You're Probably Onto Something Real

You ever hit that point where you're googling the hell out of something, scouring Reddit, blogs, Medium posts, podcasts—literally every corner of the internet—and you still can't find anyone who gets exactly what you're going through?

Yeah, same.

Here's what I've come to realize: **When you hit that dead end, when every search comes up empty, when every resource feels kinda shallow or off—you're probably onto something genuinely real.**

Everything online is so neatly packaged nowadays. "5 steps to launch your startup," "10 ways to grow your audience," "How I built a billion-dollar company from my garage"—you've seen it all, it's everywhere. And it's not bad advice, but after a point, it's generic. It's oversimplified. It's sanitized. It doesn't capture the messy, confusing, lonely stuff you're actually going through.

Real truth—the REAL stuff you're dealing with—feels uncomfortable and doesn't fit neatly into a tweet or a listicle. It's messy, complicated, and often isolating.

I like to think that feeling alone in your journey isn't a flaw. It's validation. Embrace the isolation as proof that you're innovating. You're not alone because you're doing it wrong. You're alone because you're doing something new.

How do you know you're on your path? Because it disappears.How do you know you're truly doing something real for yourself? **Because you can't see where you're going.**
