Hi,
This is Ara. I find myself at the intersection of many things that entail art, love and beauty in all its forms. My primary expression of art is technology, I spend most of my days playing with AI to build experiences that surprise and delight people.

I really enjoy knowing more about the world and its complexity in deeper ways so I read and explore a lot. I hop between many different places. Recently, I had to send an application that required mentioning of all my addresses and turns out I had 17 addresses in the last 5 years. I have travelled to 30 and lived in 7 different countries and in many different provinces of Canada(The closest thing I have to a home). 

As a proud Canadian with Indian and South Asian heritage, I am a huge fan of nature. The Rockies have taught me more about beauty and connection than any classroom could. Whether I'm skiing down fresh powder or watching the sunset from a summit I've hiked, these moments with close friends have shaped who I am. One of my favorite stories involves being 10 feet away from a bear that taught me to love my short life more(I have pics and it did HAPPEN). 

I'm documenting more of my adventures and creative process these days. If you're curious about seeing life through my lens..
