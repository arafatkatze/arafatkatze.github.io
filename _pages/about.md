Hi,
This is Arafat I am a human alchemical. An outdoor enthusiast and avid traveler, I cherish the world's beauty and cultural richness. Books are my constant companions, and I eagerly share the knowledge and wisdom they offer. With a flair for fashion and skincare, I believe in looking good, day or night. Technology's ever-evolving canvas fascinates me, as does the world of art in all its forms. I capture life's beauty through photography, delve into fashion culture, and seek the elegance in technology. Snow holds a special place in my heart, symbolizing tranquility and excitement. My ultimate goal is to create beauty and love in the world, aspiring to a life of happiness, health, and unity.


Address:
I hop between a lot of places and recently had to send an application that required mentioning of all my addresses, turns out I had 17 addresses in the last 5 years. I have lived in 5 different countries and many different provinces of Canada. The closest thing I have to home would be Canada. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
