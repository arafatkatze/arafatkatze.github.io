Hi,
This is Ara. I find myself at the intersection of many things that entail art, love and beauty in all its forms. My primary expression of art is technology, I spend most of my days playing with AI to build experiences that delight people.

I really love knowing more about the world and its complexity in deeper ways so I read and explore a lot, I have travelled to 30 and have lived in 7 different countries and in many different provinces of Canada(The closest thing I have to a home). 

As a proud Canadian with Indian and South Asian heritage, I am a huge fan of nature, the Rockies have taught me so much about beauty, connection and self discovery. Whether I'm skiing down fresh powder or watching the sunset from a summit I've hiked, these moments with close friends have shaped my life. One of my favorite stories involves being 10 feet away from a bear that taught me to love my short life more(I have pics and it did HAPPEN). 

I'm documenting more of my adventures and creative process these days. If you're curious about seeing life through my lens, here's a few links..
