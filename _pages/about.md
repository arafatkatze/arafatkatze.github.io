This is Ara (pronounced era like the beginning of an era). I find myself at the intersection of many things that entail art, love and beauty in all its forms. My primary expression of art is technology, I spend most of my days [playing with AI](/projects/AgenticAi) to build experiences that delight people. 


I like to find art and [beauty](projects/communalArt/) wherever I go and whatever I do, sometimes it's [staring at graffiti](projects/Art/), other times it's in the delight of seeing an old friend. In the past, I had been a wandering spirit so I travelled a lot and after fulfilling this rite of passage I want to settle down in the bay area and build relationships that last for the rest of my life. 


As a Canadian with Indian and Asian heritage, I am a huge fan of nature, the Rockies have taught me so much about beauty, connection and self discovery. Whether I'm skiing down fresh powder or watching the sunset from a summit I've hiked, these moments with close friends have shaped my life. I would love to do intense adventures in nature as much as I can to get me out of my mind and into my own body (PS. If you drive me to a ski hill, I will come). 

I'm documenting more of my adventures and creative process these days. If you're curious about seeing life through my lens, here's a few links...
