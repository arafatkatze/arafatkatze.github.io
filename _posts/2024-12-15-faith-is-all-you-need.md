A famous line, echoing Stoic thought, says "The mind can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven". 

Underneath that phrase is the idea that it's not really about the external situation you're in, but the internal experience of your consciousness that really counts. Back in university, I struggled to keep up and couldn't seem to perform the mental gymnastics required to become a good student. I even blamed myself until a professor straight up told me, "Your grades reflect your belief in the system."
 
At first I thought this was supposed to motivate me, but after a few days I realized he was right, I simply didn't believe in the system, and that pattern kept repeating itself in my life: like, later at my dream job, I'd work weekends, grind late into Friday nights, and it felt joyful and fine for a while until one day I woke up and something inside me died, and no matter how much I tried to blame external factors like sleep or health, deep down I knew I'd lost faith.

My natural instinct is to blame myself and "try to make it work" but I don't think that's always right, if there's something deep knawing at you constantly why fight yourself every step of the way, why not just accept the wisdom of my emotions to accept that I used to love this but this is not for me any more(a graceful breakup maybe?). 
 
When I moved on to my next gig, though, that faith was back, and I worked harder than ever. (It was easier to work harder but harder to work less). It still felt effortless. It seems like the Stoics (or perhaps Milton) had it right: the mind really does shape your reality, or perhaps it's not the mind but your faith (and more precisely, the degree of faith you have in your work).

Next time I find a job, faith is literally the only thing I'm optimizing for. I've made enough money, I don't care anymore. If I force myself to work on something I don't believe in, then that's a total waste of my time. Faith single handedly transforms your internal experience. That's why people willingly go barefoot on epic religious pilgrimages but take the car to a grocery store two blocks away. You can't trick yourself into believing, so the real move is finding something worth believing in something that genuinely pulls you instead of something you have to keep dragging yourself toward. Because that subtle shift in motivation is literally everything.
